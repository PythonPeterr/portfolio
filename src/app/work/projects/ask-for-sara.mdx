## Overview

Ask For Sara is an AI-powered voice agent SaaS application developed for Meijer & Knijnenberg that revolutionizes how businesses manage their HubSpot CRM. Instead of manually entering data into spreadsheets and CRM systems, users can simply talk to Sara using natural language, and she handles all the data entry, updates, and CRM management tasks automatically.

## The Problem

Sales teams and recruiters spend hours each week on administrative CRM tasks - updating contact information, logging interactions, creating deals, and managing pipelines. This manual data entry is:
- Time-consuming and tedious
- Prone to human error
- Takes focus away from actual client work
- Often leads to incomplete or outdated CRM data

## The Solution

Ask For Sara transforms CRM administration into a natural conversation. Users can:
- Speak naturally about their client interactions
- Update contact information conversationally
- Create and manage deals through voice commands
- Log activities and notes without touching a keyboard
- Get real-time confirmations and feedback

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands context and intent from conversational speech, eliminating the need for structured commands.
- **HubSpot Integration**: Deep integration with HubSpot CRM API for seamless data synchronization and real-time updates.
- **Voice-First Interface**: Optimized for voice interaction with intuitive feedback and conversation flow.
- **Intelligent Data Extraction**: Automatically extracts relevant information from conversations and maps it to correct CRM fields.
- **Multi-Entity Support**: Handles contacts, companies, deals, tasks, and notes in a single conversation.
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all voice interactions and CRM updates for compliance and review.

## Technologies Used

- **AI/Voice**: Advanced speech recognition and natural language understanding

- **Real-Time Processing**: Low-latency voice processing for natural conversation flow

## Technical Challenges

Building a voice agent that truly understands conversational CRM updates required solving several challenges:

1. **Context Management**: Maintaining conversation context across multiple CRM entities and operations while staying natural
2. **Data Validation**: Ensuring voice-extracted data is accurate and complete before committing to CRM
3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handling misunderstandings and ambiguous requests through clarifying questions
4. **Real-Time Performance**: Processing voice input with minimal latency to maintain conversation flow
