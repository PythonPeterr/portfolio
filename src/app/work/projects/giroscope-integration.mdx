## Overview

Built Giroscope out of personal frustration with the existing portfolio analysis tools available to DeGiro investors. As someone who wanted deeper insights and a better user experience, I designed and developed a complete SaaS platform from the ground up, handling everything from product design to engineering and deployment.

## Key Features

- **Portfolio Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis tools for DeGiro investment portfolios with deeper insights than existing solutions.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Redesigned interface focused on usability and providing actionable insights at a glance.
- **Real-Time Data**: Integration with DeGiro to sync portfolio data and provide up-to-date analytics.
- **Custom Metrics**: Advanced analytics and custom metrics tailored to retail investors' needs.

## Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**: Database for user data and portfolio analytics
- **FastAPI**: Backend API for data processing and business logic
- **React**: Frontend interface for portfolio visualization
- **GCP**: Cloud infrastructure for hosting and scaling

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was building and scaling as a solo founder. I owned every aspect - product, engineering, and iteration. While I successfully scaled to ~500 users, I learned firsthand about the realities of early traction, retention dynamics, and distribution constraints. Eventually, priorities shifted and motivation to expand further waned, leading me to move on to new opportunities.

## Outcome

Successfully validated the product idea and gained hands-on experience with the full lifecycle of building and scaling a SaaS product. Reached 500 users as a solo founder, learning valuable lessons about product-market fit, user acquisition, and the challenges of bootstrapped growth.
